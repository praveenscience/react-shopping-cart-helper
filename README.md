# OverView :
When it comes to grocery shopping, it's always a nightmare to remember things to note down and buy it off. Being a WhatsApp user, We always tend to have the items to be bought, always spread out across multiple dates and it's really hard when it comes to what we need to buy.
So this app makes it lazier and easier. This is quick React App using CRA and Bootstrap. this app will work both on Mobile and Desktop, with a Mobile First approach.
This is essentially a list of items to choose from by taking your mobile phone around your house to find the missing things and add them and export it to WhatsApp!

# What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a monthlong celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. It is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.
# Why Should I Contribute?
It’s not just about the t-shirts or stickers. It's about supporting Open Source Community. It's about celebrating open source by contributing what you are interested in.If you’ve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started.
# What Can I Contribute?
Look for the projects which interests you,learn how can you contribute to a particular project,fork the repository and submit your PR;
# Installation For this Project:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
